\item[\registerop{rd}] The position of the character or -1 if the
  character is not found.

\subsubsection*{Description}

The \subroutine{rindex} subroutine searches from the end of a string
pointed to by its first argument, for the first instance character
supplied as its second argument.  The search proceeds until the
character is found, or an optional limit, supplied as the third
argument is reached.  If the character is not found then -1 is
returned to the caller.

\subsubsection*{Failure modes}

This subroutine has no run-time failure modes beyond its constraints.
