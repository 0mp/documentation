\subsubsection*{Description}

The \subroutine{basename} subroutine takes a single string argument,
containing a path, and returns a pointer to the file name portion of
the supplied string.  The space for the resulting string is contained
in the DTrace machine state structure, \verb|mstate| which is
automatically de-allocated.

\subsubsection*{Failure modes}

This subroutine has no run-time failure modes beyond its constraints.
