\subsubsection*{Description}

The \subroutine{index} subroutine searches from the beginning of a
string pointed to by its first argument, for a character supplied as
the second argument.  The search proceeds until the character is
found, or an optional limit, supplied as the third argument is
reached.  If the character is not found then -1 is returned to the
caller.
