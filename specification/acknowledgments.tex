\section*{Acknowledgments}
The authors of this report thank the creators of DTrace, including
Bryan Cantril, Adam Leventhal and Michael Shapiro for a spectacular
contribution to the field of operating-system design, and in
particular for designing the data structures, instructions, and other
elements of DTrace described in this specificaiton.  Some of the text
in this specification has been excerpted from the excellent comments
present in the original source code.

One cannot work with DTrace without running across the work of Brendan
Gregg, author of the DTrace Toolkit, as well as \emph{DTrace: Dynamic
  Tracing in Oracle Solaris, macOS and FreeBSD}, and to him we also
owe a debt of thanks.

Several people, including some of the original developers of DTrace,
reviewed this report during various stages of its development and so
we'd like to extend our thanks to Matthew Ahrens, Mark Johnston,
Samuel Lepetit, Adam Leventhal, and David Pacheco.

The authors of this report also thank other members of the CADETS team, and
our past and current research collaborators at BAE Systems, the University of
Cambridge, and Memorial University Newfoundland:

The port of DTrace to FreeBSD was carried out in 2007 by John Birrell
who, sadly, passed away in 2009, and we dedicate this report to his
memory.

\noindent
Finally, we are grateful to Angelos Keromytis, DARPA Transparent Computing
program manager, who has offered both technical insight and support throughout
this work.
