OpenDTrace is a dynamic tracing facility integrated into the Solaris, FreeBSD,
and Mac OS X operating systems -- with ports also available for Linux and
Windows.
Dynamic tracing allows system administrators and software developers to
develop short scripts (in the D programming language) that instruct
OpenDTrace to
instrument aspects of system operation, gather data, and present it for human
interpretation or mechanical processing.
While there is documentation available for the D programming
language, command-line tools, and general DTrace-based investigation and
operation, the internal formats to OpenDTrace are documented via the
source code.
This report acts as a de facto specification for those formats, including
the DTrace Intermediate Format (DIF), which is a bytecode that D scripts are
compiled into for safe execution within the kernel, and the DTrace Object
Format (DOF), which bundles together complete scripts along with their
associated constants and metadata.

%\section{Motivation}
\section{Background}

\textbf{XXRW: Ideally, there would be a more detailed description of both the
usage model, and also the architectural elements, of DTrace here.
That and some citations to DTrace documentation, the FreeBSD/Solaris books,
etc.}

The original DTrace code was designed and developed by Sun
Microsystems to solve a particular problem, being able to instrument
systems that were currently deployed, without requiring the
recompilation of any code.\cite{DTrace2004}.  The DTrace system was
written in a portable style typical of code from the Sun Microsystems
Kernel Development group in the early 2000s.  Shortly after the
release of the original DTrace system a port was made, by John Birrel,
to the FreeBSD Operating System.  A port was also made by Apple
Computer to their Mac OS X at about the same time.  DTrace gained
popularity as a dynamic tracing system throughout the first decade of
the 21st Century and its usage is well documented.\cite{}

OpenDTrace is made up of several components, including kernel code,
user space libraries, and command line tools.  The OpenDTrace system
uses information generated during code compilation to expose a set of
trace points with which users and programs can interact.  These trace
points can be the entry and exit points of functions as well as system
calls, or they can be arbitrary points in the instruction stream,
marked out with a set of standardized macros.  From the user's point
of view tracing is activated by a command line program,
\texttt{dtrace}, but any program that is compiled with the OpenDTrace
libraries may initiate tracing, so long as it has sufficient
privileges.

The OpenDTrace privilege model is relatively simple, any program that
wishes to trace another program must be running with \emph{root}
privileges.  Some operating systems, such as Illumos, provide a more
nuanced privilege model, the details of which are discussed further in
Section~\ref{sec:privilege}.

Tracepoints are collected into one of many \emph{providers} which dictate
the capabilites of the tracepoint and how it interacts with the overall
tracing system.  Providers exist for system calls (\texttt{syscall}),
function boundary tracing (\texttt{fbt}), timing services (\texttt{profile}),
as well as specific subsystems such as the network (\texttt{ip}, \texttt{tcp}),
filesystem (\texttt{vfs}) and process scheduler (\texttt{proc}).
Arbitrary trace points can be added to the kernel via the
statically defined trace point (\texttt{sdt}) provider.  User space programs
are traced either with the \texttt{pid} provider or using the 
statically defined trace point (\texttt{usdt}) provider.q

\section{Document Structure}

This report specifies a number of aspects of OpenDTrace's operation:

\begin{description}

\item[The OpenDTrace Operational Model] described in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:opendtrace-operation} gives a general overview of
  the internals of the OpenDTrace system, including the privilege
  model, trace-point format and a description of how user space
  programs are traced.

\item[The Compact Trace Format] described in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:opendtrace-ctf} explains the data extracted from
  compiled object code that is used by OpenDTrace to create trace
  points and extract function arguments and types.

\item[The DTrace Object Format (DOF)] described in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:opendtrace-object-format} is a file-like format linking
  together a set of sections describing OpenDTrace code, string constants, and
  other aspects of a complete compiled OpenDTrace script.

\item[The DTrace Intermediate Format (DIF)] is the bytecode that the
  executable elements of OpenDTrace scripts are compiled to.
  This is a simple RISC-like instruction set with constrained execution
  properties (e.g., only forward branches).
  Chapter~\ref{chap:opendtrace-intermediate-format} describes the instruction
  format and common instruction semantics.

\item[DTrace Instructions] are the individual RISC instructions performing
  a variety of operations including register access, memory access, arithmetic
  operations, and calling various built-in subroutines available to scripts in
  execution.
  Chapter~\ref{chap:opendtrace-instruction-reference} enumerates the instructions,
  their arguments, and their semantics.

\item[DTrace Variable Records] describe the set of variables (local, global,
  or thread-local) operated on by a OpenDTrace script.
  Chapter~\ref{chap:opendtrace-variable-records} specifies this record format.

\item[DTrace Subroutines] are available to scripts, providing access to
  higher-level behavior, such as memory copying, string comparison, and so on.
  Chapter~\ref{chap:opendtrace-subroutines} describes the available built-in
  subroutines.
