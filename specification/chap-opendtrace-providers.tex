A significant portion of the user facing functionality of OpenDTrace
are presented via a set of \emph{providers} which expose probe points
and data structures in froms that are specific to a particular type of
code or subsystem.  This appendix lists the currently existing set of
providers along with the rules they use for exposing data to the
user.  Providers that are stable, which is to say they do not change
after each recompilation of the code, we list and describe the probe
points and their arguments.
