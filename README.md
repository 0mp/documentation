## OpenDTrace Specification

Current version of the [OpenDTrace
Specification](https://github.com/opendtrace/documentation/blob/master/specification/opendtrace-specification.pdf)

In order to checkout and build the specification you will need a full
installation of a modern (La)Tex system including the following
packages:

  * algpseudocode
  * amsmath
  * appendix
  * booktabs
  * bytefield
  * color
  * fullpage
  * graphicx
  * hyperref
  * marginnote
  * listings
  * setspace
  * times

Once LaTeX and the packages are installed you can build the document
by typeing `make` in the `specification/` directory.
