\subsubsection*{Calling convention}

\begin{description}
\item[\registerop{rd}] Pointer to allocated data or NULL.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Description}

The \subroutine{alloca} subroutine allocates scratch space in the
DTrace state machine structure.  Although this subroutine does not
allocate space on the process stack, it does act similarly to the
alloca macro, in that the space disappears without an explicit call to
a \subroutine{free} routine, once the DTrace machine state structure
is deallocated.
