\section*{Abstract}

DTrace is a dynamic tracing facility offering full-system instrumentation, a
high degree of flexibility, and portable semantics across a range of
operating systems.
Originally designed and implemented by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle),
user-facing aspects of DTrace, such as the D language and command-line tools,
are well defined and documented.
However, DTrace's internal formats -- the DTrace Intermediate Format (DIF) and
DTrace Object Format (DOF) -- have primarily been documented through source
code comments rather than a structured specification.
This technical report specifies these formats in order to better support the
development of more comprehensive tests, new underlying execution subtrates
(such as just-in-time compilation), and future extensions.
%DIF is a RISC bytecode into which D scripts are compiled, describing the
%specific executable actions in a script.
%DOF is the container format containing a set of headers and sections for
%variables, probe implementations, constants, and other content required to
%represent a complete script.
